# ido-mini

A [helm-mini](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) in ido

Ido's -
- smarter sorting
- snappier speed

meets helm-mini's -
- informatively-colored candidates list
- convenience of a single command to switch to buffers, open recentf
  files, and create new buffers.

Plus, some improvements of its own -
1. If a recentf entry is already visited by a buffer, put the entry at
   the end of the (recentf?) candidates list.
2. (planned) tweak `ido-mini-use-paths` to search and display not just
   buffer names but also their file paths, wherever applicable.
3. (planned) show documentation of functions from smex, akin to C-j in
   helm-M-x

## Installation
`ido-mini` requires [dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) and `ido`.

`ido-vertical-mode` can be used to view candidates vertically.

`ido-mini` assumes you use Emacs' built-in `recentf-mode`. If not, simply add `(recentf-mode)` to your init.

## Key customization
**IMPORTANT**

In Ido, key customization is sadly NOT done the usual way. Instead,
you write a function to change keybindings (you want to use
`ido-completion-map`) and add that to `ido-setup-hook'. See section
'Customization' in (find-library "ido")

For fuzzy matching, install the flex-ido package. It's not always useful, you can define a command to toggle it -
```
(defun my/ido-toggle-flex ()
  "Toggle the value of `ido-enable-flex-matching'."
  (interactive)
  (setq flx-ido-mode (not flx-ido-mode)))
```
and bind it to a key.

## Known issues
flx-ido and recent versions of ido override ido-mini's candidate coloring. As of now it's a choice between flx-ido/ido's matched string highlighting, and ido-mini's informatively colored candidates. If you'd rather have the latter, add `(setq flx-ido-use-faces nil)` and `(setq ido-use-faces nil)` to your init respectively.

## TODO
1. When called twice in succession, quit ido-mini
2. color the matched substring in the candidates?
3. store only search terms in input history, not the selected buffer
   names/file paths
4. Mimic exact C-j (`ido-select-text`) and RET behaviour
   (`ido-exit-minibuffer`)
5. What if we search for files (perhaps only in user-specified
   directories, when provided) when there are no matches in the buffer
   list as well as in recentf?
6. Add animated
7. Add indicator if flx-ido-mode is enabled
8. Add tests
9. Don't fail if recentf-list is nil
