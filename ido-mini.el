;;;; Listen up, fatuous serfs in the lands of Helm and Ido who know
;;;; not the possibilities!
;;;; <dramatic pause>
;;;; <imperiously> Use `ido-mini' in your miserable init.el.

;;;; helm-mini's convenience of a single command to swich to buffers,
;;;; open recentf files, and create new buffers, and the informatively
;;;; colorful list of candidates, but with ido's smarter sorting and
;;;; snappy speed.

;;;; Plus, some improvements of its own -
;;;; 1. If a recentf entry is already visited by a buffer, put the
;;;;    entry at the end of the candidates list.
;;;; 2. (temporarily disabled) tweak `im/use-paths' to search and
;;;;    display not just buffer names but also their file paths,
;;;;    wherever applicable.
;;;; 3. (planned) show documentation of functions from smex, akin to
;;;;    C-j in helm-M-x

;;;; No fifty commands to do the work of one, no uninformatively
;;;; colorless candidates list, no helm slowing down your init or
;;;; hanging your Emacs, and no more [Display not ready]!

;; - unsaved buffers                - buffer-modified-p
;; - buffers modified outside emacs - verify-visited-file-modtime - helm-buffer-saved-out
